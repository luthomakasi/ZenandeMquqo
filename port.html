                We won four out of five debates namely against a composite Lukhanji League team twice, Alexander Road High School and Merrifield College and lost once against a Rhini Debate League Team.
                The team ranked 3rd overall out of 20 teams and faced another Rhini Debate League Team in the semifinal where we unfortunately lost.

            <li><b>NIDPSC 2023:</b> <br> <br>
                I auditioned to go to the National Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships by making a five minute speech at school. 
                There is no provincial level. The competition consist of the best performing schools in South Africa. 
                Only four people out of the people who auditioned in my school were chosen and I was one of them. 
                I then had to choose a book to read from for the Interpretive Reading part of the competition. 
                I had to practice Impromptu Speaking as it was one of the categories in the competition. I had to extend my speech to at least 7 minutes.
                I also had to prepare for debates as that was one of the categories. I prepared everyday after that. 
                I attended the National Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships at St Mary's Diocesan School for Girls at St Kloof, KwaZulu Natal. 
                The competition had two rounds for each category before choosing people to go to the finals. I made it to the finals for Interpretive Reading, Impromptu Speaking and my Prepared Persuasive speech. 
                I came 4th overall and made it into the South African Delegation with 13 students that are going to Canberra, Australia next year in April.</li>

        <p>NIDPSC 2023 On the 22 of September I travelled to St Mary's Diocesan School for Girls in St Kloof, KwaZulu Natal.
            I participated in the National Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships. 
            The competition is prestigious and I competed against some of the greatest speakers in the country.
            I participated in Interpretive Reading, Impromptu Speaking, Debating and Prepared Persuasive Speaking.
            I made it to the final rounds for Interpretive Reading, Impromptu Speaking and Persuasive Speaking.
            I came 4th overall making it into the South African Delegation that is travelling to Canberra Girls' Grammar School in Canberra, Australia next year in April.
            I am honoured to be part of a team with such talented individuals. I met great people who had lovely stories to share.
            The competition was overall wonderful. My prepared speech was titled: The Paper wall and is attached below</p>

                    <p id="modal" style="color: black;">There is a wall in our motherland separating the poor and the wealthy.
                        The Paper Wall built entirely of money that only one side can reap the benefits of. 
                        Each side of that wall looks completely different from the other. 
                        According to the World Bank Group approximately 55.5 percent (30.3 million people) in South Africa live in poverty. 
                        Entering the heart of KwaZulu Natal from the King Shaka International airport, I came across a road. 
                        On one side of the road we have these beautiful houses and I can imagine the view that they have from the top of the cars on the road. 
                        On the other side of the road we have shacks upon shacks. 
                        I can imagine the winds, storms and rain that could damage the homes of so many people. 
                        I don't have to imagine because this is the reality. This is a norm in South Africa. 
                        One of my teachers always says,”I expect to see beggars near the robots in East London. 
                        This is how things are.” It’s an expectation. We have accepted it. It wouldn’t be normal for the road to have nothing but cars and employed pedestrians. 
                        In every corner of South Africa, you will find poverty. We see Americans and Europeans raising funds, talking about how poor Africa is and motivating others to donate.
                        I always find it funny when my schoolmates mock the westerners by asking, “Which Africa are they talking about? I have food, internet, water and electricity. 
                        Where is the poverty that they speak about?” The truth is that the Paper Wall is so meticulous in its segregation that the middle and higher class have no idea what poverty looks like. 
                        That’s why they give temporary solutions to an urgent and permanent problem. 
                        It is a great initiative but simply donating toiletries, food and clothing to the poor and feeling great about yourself afterwards does not solve the issue. 
                        It helps but then after a while it seems like those items were never donated. They disappear into the cycle of poverty. 
                        I stand here as a representative of the poor. Yes, I am part of the millions of people who are in the lower class. 
                        I’ll tell you the truth about poverty. The cruelty of our economy. For some of us, it’s the look on our mother’s faces when they feel too ashamed to tell us that they can’t afford what we want. 
                        It’s the unsettling feeling when we have money in our hands and we have to think of necessities before desires. I know the stench of poverty. 
                        It smells like death. Dead bodies whether human or animal. We die of natural causes everyday. 
                        I used to love the rain, now I have to work in the rain. I can place buckets to catch the water dripping from the roof of our shack with my eyes closed now. 
                        My body is accustomed to waking up to throw the water out. Suddenly I relate to the man who sweeps water back into the ocean with a broom. 
                        The wind rattles our little zinc walls mockingly. I don’t have to go outside to feel the weather, the holes in the walls and roof let everything in. 
                        Some of us make it out. Education is one of the ways. The privileged population think that it's only fair if they fund the academically strong and talented individuals. 
                        We all know that only a small percentage of people have these talents. Someone once said to me, “You got lucky. That’s why you’re here.” It’s true. 
                        I have to be academically smart and talented to survive or I will follow the paths of my brothers and sisters. 
                        Teenage pregnancy; toxic relationships fueled by hunger, sex and money; prostitution and theft. 
                        Issues like violence against women happen on a larger scale because poverty is at a massive scale. 
                        When my brothers are unemployed and hungry they look for ways to let out their rage from these issues and unfortunately, my sisters become prey to cowardly men. 
                        Do you really want to know why women don’t speak out? My community is used to violence. 
                        It’s just another day in our community when a man hits his wife or a girl gets raped. 
                        You get so overwhelmed by poverty that every other issue blurs into the midst of weary thoughts. 
                        Poverty is a deadly disease and the wealthy treat it like an easily remedied sickness. 
                        Poverty is an urgent issue that you should be worried about. When we get poorer, it only decreases the value of South Africa’s economy.
                        The poorer we are, the less desirable a country South Africa becomes. South Africa will always have high numbers in gender-based violence, gang violence, 
                        disease and unemployment if you stay on your side of the wall and do nothing. What do we do? How do we provide more effective solutions?
                        Equal education: During apartheid there was a distinct difference between education for white people and people of colour. 
                        Black South Africans received the worst education further promoting segregation and decreasing the chances of black excellence. 
                        Today we see inequality in the education system as clear as day. Take Clarendon High School for Girls and compare it to Zanempucuko Secondary School. 
                        They’re both public schools but so different. As per BizCommunity only 20% of the country's 25 000 government schools provide a good quality education, while 80% are dysfunctional. 
                        We have state of the art facilities on one side and on the other side of the wall we have underdeveloped infrastructure that hasn’t been tended to since the democratic elections in 1994. 
                        We have internet access and Information Technology as a subject on one side and schools that cannot offer Information Technology as a subject 
                        because the school facilities cannot have computers due to theft and poor internet connection. We want to give every child the 
                        opportunity to receive quality education whether they are academically gifted or not. 
                        Not everyone is Siya Kolisi and will receive a rugby scholarship to a private school. 
                        Not everyone is Zenande Mquqo and will receive an academic scholarship to Clarendon High School for Girls. 
                        And for some of us, a 60 percent average is the best we can do. Only providing funds to the poor who achieve higher marks promotes inequality. 
                        It is an incentive but only one that a small percentage of people can get. 
                        Give that opportunity to all children by improving the quality of education in poor communities because you can’t send every child to a 
                        private institution. Fundraisers can be done to provide resources and materials such as textbooks, devices and internet connection. 
                        The world of technology is evolving and everyone needs to be equipped to get into the working field with these skills. 
                        Putting pressure on the government to provide these resources and giving what you can to improve the quality of education in these schools. 
                        You cannot complain about a high rate of unemployment when you give the majority of our people low quality education. 
                        Education is a basic human right not a privilege. Youth development-centres: According to Africa.com, 
                        about 37% of South Africa is made up of the youth. According to Statista 51.52% of the youth is unemployed. 
                        We need the youth of South Africa to start being involved in making a difference whether it’s on a small scale or large scale.
                        Youth development-centres can be places where the youth is challenged to do something for themselves and their country. 
                        These centres will be in every community monitored by council members. These centres will frequently host events in larger cities and 
                        accommodate the youth so that people from the lower, middle and upper class can interact and understand each other. 
                        The wall will finally be broken. These development programs can include job creation and opportunities for the unemployed youth. 
                        The development centres will have professionals there to help the qualified but unemployed individuals start their careers. 
                        The unqualified and uneducated youth will be provided with information by the youth centres on what they can do to find employment whether it be jobs that 
                        don’t require a lot of skill or providing classes and short courses that can get them the minimum qualifications needed for employment 
                        in specific career-fields. This can include fundraising for groups of people to be sent to TVET colleges or institutions 
                        where they can study and get an NSC. These centres include educational conversations and debates about issues in South Africa so 
                        that we know exactly what the youth want to change and improve. This can help educate people on issues they were not aware about. 
                        Lessons on financial literacy and how to make money with what you have are fundamental in ensuring a future for our country. 
                        The financial market is ever changing. With the introduction of cryptocurrency and bitcoins it is only a matter of time before these new ideas become popular 
                        enough that they are necessary for international trade. Technology is also developing at a faster rate and many people have found easy ways 
                        to make money online. Most of these jobs do not require qualifications but basic English skills. 
                        These jobs involve working with people worldwide and receiving payment in euros or dollars which is an advantage as a 
                        South African because the value of those currencies is higher than ours. These programs can give the youth a platform to share 
                        innovative solutions and be involved in projects to tackle issues in South Africa. 
                        We have electrical engineers who can put Eskom out of business and they are just sitting at home. 
                        The youth is creative and can come up with many ways to deal with the electricity and water crisis. 
                        They just need their ideas to be heard by like-minded people who can drive the project forward. 
                        These programs will also focus on getting the youth involved in politics because now is the time for change. 
                        Corruption is the dilemma of our time as our leaders care more about money than the needs of the people. 
                        V from Alan Moore’s comic said,”People should not fear their government. The government should fear the people.” If the youth enter the political 
                        world in numbers and gain the support of the people, we could change the political and economic structure of this country. 
                        The youth understands that corruption is the reason why we have so many issues in South Africa and would come up with better 
                        anti-corruption policies as well as repair the damages of our past leaders. By giving the youth this information and allowing the 
                        youth to have a say in what happens in their communities, we give them power. These development programs can include job creation and 
                        opportunities for the unemployed youth. The development centres will have professionals there to help the qualified but unemployed 
                        individuals start their careers. The unqualified and uneducated youth will be provided with information by the youth centres on what 
                        they can do to find employment whether it be jobs that don’t require a lot of skill or providing classes and short courses that can 
                        get them the minimum qualifications needed for employment in specific career-fields. This can include fundraising for groups of people to 
                        be sent to TVET colleges or institutions where they can study and get an NSC. In conclusion, the Paper Wall is not impossible to deconstruct. 
                        The cycle of poverty can be broken. I dream and work for a South Africa where we are not separated by money. 
                        A South Africa that is truly democratic and caters for all of its citizens. We have sat and waited for politicians to solve our 
                        problems for too long. It is time. Break the wall and be the change.</p>
