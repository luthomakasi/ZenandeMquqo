                  <h2>My Story</h2>
                  <p>"Burn if you must, but rise from the dust." My peers describe me as an overachiever but I understand that all I am and all I have right now is not enough. 
                    It is not even close to overachieving. I was not always a public speaker. All of the abilities I have are not talents but a reflection of hard work and effort. 
                    The first time I made a speech, I froze and ran off the stage. I told myself that I would never do something like that again. The first time I wrote a poem, 
                    I was told that I lacked creativity. The first time I sang, someone told me I should just lip sing and blend in with the choir. 
                    I was told I wasn't good enough to win and if I won it just meant that my competitors were bad. Academically, 
                    I excelled without putting in much work and it was the only field in my life where I didn't have to try so hard to be exceptional. 
                    I only started working hard academically when someone took first place. My competitive nature has pushed me to achieve more. Even if I feel lazy, 
                    I look around me and I see the effort others put in and I immediately start working more than they are. My achievements in public speaking, drama, writing, academics and music are daily reminders that I overcame those failures and comments. 
                    I worked on myself and became who people did not think I could be. The first time I said I wanted to speak on an international stage, the whole room erupted into laughter. At the time, it was only a dream. I use every opportunity 
                    I get because I understand that it has the ability to take me to another level. I understand that talent alone means nothing but the effort you put in makes everything better. 
                    I did not have talent, I learnt how to deliver an exceptional speech, I practiced how to sing and get my notes right, I read books and learned how to use words effectively. 
                    There is no achievement that was easy for me to get because of talent, I had to work.</p>

                  <h2>Campaign Details</h2>
                  <p> During term 2, it was announced that my school, Clarendon High School for Girls, would choose a team of four individuals to represent them at the National Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships. 
                    We were told that this is primarily a grade 11 competition so the chances of grade 10s being chosen were slim. 
                    The chances of a junior being chosen were even slimmer. I made a five minute speech and auditioned anyway. 
                    I was chosen as one of the students that would represent the school at the competition. My prepared persuasive speech was titled: The Paper Wall. 
                    I present poverty as an issue in our country using personal experiences and information outside of my own experience as examples to highlight the issue. 
                    I share effective solutions and challenge the listener to make a difference. I made it to the final rounds for my persuasive speech, Interpretive Reading and Impromptu Speaking. 
                    I was placed 4th overall and made it into the South African Team going to Canberra in Australia next year.</p>

                  <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
                   <p>This matters so much to me because this opportunity did not come easily. 
                    I had to work harder as a grade 9 junior to compete with experienced and amazing speakers in grade 11. 
                    A lot of people underestimated me and at times it caused me to doubt myself and my abilities. 
                    I had to go back, look at my journey in public speaking and remember that I was Zenande Mquqo. 
                    I do not quit. I am not afraid of failure. The same people who once underestimated me from the beginning of my journey now marvelled at my abilities. 
                    My name means "to grow and multiply" and that is exactly what I have done and will continue to do. 
                    I have grown into someone who doesn't run away from a challenge but seeks it. I have grown into someone with incredible resistance and endurance. 
                    I have multiplied talents that I was told I could never have. I have multiplied opportunities that were deemed impossible. 
                    The opportunity to push myself further by competing internationally is recognition of my efforts and means so much to me. 
                    It' is something I thought was only a dream and I'm just a step closer to making it a reality. 
                    The only step missing to make it real is just getting there. I'm already preparing. I only need funds to get to the championships and deliver. 
                    It would be greatly appreciated if I could receive sponsorship for travel and the competition.</p>
